# [Ubiquitous and Personal Computing Lab](https://www.ubicomp-lab.org)👋 
## Computing for Anyone, at Anytime, Anywhere

We research, develop and validate novel computing technologies to improve health, productivity, and well-being of individuals.  

Devoted to creating computing technologies that can be used anytime, anywhere, by anyone, we envision a world where everyone is able to design and conduct self-experiments to test their personal hypothesis, to gain a better understanding into the-self, and to maximize their potential.
